**Australia Post Code Boundaries**

All Post Code Boundaries mapped to google earth as a kmz file with differentiated boundary colours. 
This map can be used to base any "as the crow flies" dijkstra's variant algorithm distance calculations. 
An additional OpenStreetMap kmz is included to support complex distance calculations and boundry street/address value mapping.
